## Bouncing Box
### Our goal for this game is to learn how to bring together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We use HTML to define our structure, CSS to define the style of that structure, and JavaScript in order to implement behavior. One of the primary ways we can implement behavior in JavaScript is by making modifications to the HTML and CSS in response to **events** which we will demonstrate by making this simple game.

Meet Halle, the official Operation Spark robot.
Halle has some cool moves but nobody to play with. Let's build our own game using Halle!
