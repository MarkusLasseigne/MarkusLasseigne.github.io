			<li>0:00xm/00/00/2020:
				<p>blah blah blah</p>
			</li>
			-->
			<li>7:40pm/10/05/2023:
				<p>Made Home page more responsive.</p>
				<p>Consolidated Index Scripts.</p>
				<p>Tweaked colors values.</p>
				<p>Added fancy button animations and modernized button stacking.</p>
				<p>Actually Fixed Index buttons.</p>
			</li>
			<li>5:20pm/10/04/2023:
				<p>Tweaked a Majge Level 2 months ago, never got around to change log.</p>
				<p>Fixed Index buttons not changing on refresh.</p>
				<p>Made the Home page more responsive / better looking.</p>
				<p>Updated Change-Log, also adding a copy template.</p>
			</li>
			<li>1:08am/23/5/2020:
				<p>Updated Majge Menu to use a folder-tab system, placed unused script files into a text doc to save if needed, updated Portfolio to distinguish my projects from OpSpark given projects.</p>
				<p>All updates past April 20th did not have git pushes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>12:00pm/10/4-5/2020:
				<p>Revamped about 85% of Project Majg'e for better modularity:</p>
				<p>Levels now use a general "global" object for better collision managment.</p>
				<p>Added win function for inputable win conditions and win screen.</p>
				<p>Improved clear function to clear the screen or game based on input parameters.</p>
				<p>Moved general variables and key management to game index html.</p>
			</li>
			<li>7:10pm/20/4/2020:
				<p>Reformatted the buttons to take advantage of a main paths json file, bringing the root index from 254 lines to 154 lines. Updated old index save with the previous root Index. Massively improved project Majg'e's collision system to be 1000x more realistic.</p>
			</li>
			<li>2:48pm/8/4/2020:
				<p>Finished project Lets-Get-Functional, last 2 were done learning of the forEach method that the teacher used on his page, but because I'd literally been looking for what forEach does, I count it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>11:40pm/7/4/2020:
				<p>Had a heart attack, turns out the last merge I did I copied underpants.js into index.js in lets get functional and nothing worked, but I fixed it using the GitHub commit history.</p>
			</li>
			<li>7:00pm/7/4/2020:
				<p>Fixed a problem with a dependencies json, got to topthreetags on Lets-Get-Functional and improved its and some of underpants commenting.</p>
			</li>
			<li>7:40pm/3/4/2020:
				<p>All current problems with project Lets-Get-Functional fixed thanks to the coding instructor, so that I can get to work to complete the project itself, and adjusted root Index accordingly. Finished up to the averageBalance function.</p>
			</li>
			<li>4:40pm/1/4/2020:
				<p>Added everything needed of the root index for project Lets-Get-Functional, and added files for the project, though future changes needed. Removed uneeded code on project Majge.</p>
			</li>
			<li>12:00pm/1/4/2020:
				<p>Added sounds for picking up the coins and updated parts of the coderoute file for better understanding of how it works.</p>
			</li>
			<li>5:20pm/24/3/2020:
				<p>Fixed coin system on project Majg'e along with a new menu layout better representing game menus and made further optimizations in code structure, more minor code condensing/optimizing here, on root index, and on project underpants.</p>
			</li>
			<li>5:20pm/24/3/2020:
				<p>Finished project Underpants, awaiting validation of completion, not all were completed exactly to the instructions given.</p>
			</li>
			<li>5:00pm/11/3/2020:
				<p>Uploaded project Underpants files, set up its button and added its Portfolio entry; moved the Change-Log button toward the top for better ease of adding buttons; backed up root index.</p>
			</li>
			<li>6:19pm/4/3/2020:
				<p>Officially finished Billypedia project unless a fix for its test's page becomes known, and patched styling for Billypedia spec page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>10:00pm/28/2/2020:
				<p>Basically finished Billypedia project, exept 3 of the tests say not done when they are, I will likely look into combining all tests to one page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>4:44pm/26/2/2020:
				<p>Uploaded the Billypedia project and updated root index to accommodate.</p>
			</li>
			<li>6:54pm/21/2/2020:
				<p>Finished Test and Function Guru, updated Portfolio page to include both new projects, and tweaked Change-Log page and did slight spellchecking.</p>
			</li>
			<li>2:40pm/19/2/2020:
				<p>Prep for upcoming projects: Test Guru and Function Guru.</p>
			</li>
			<li>11:00pm/8-14/2/2020:
				<p>Completed the Scratch Pad Conditionals project. Improved project Majg'e collisions, added coins that give points (not quite right yet), and streamlined/optimized code for better performance.</p>
			</li>
			<li>7:20pm/7/2/2020:
				<p>Uploaded all Scratch Pad projects, then updated root Index for the new projects, and moved movement system in Majg'e for modularity.</p>
			</li>
			<li>4:20pm/4/2/2020:
				<p>Updated save/backup files to the current index and previous portfolio. Revamped Portfolio page to include more detailed info of the site. Gave my personal JS project a new name: project Majg'e.</p>
			</li>
			<li>12:30am/1/2/2020:
				<p>Changed JS engine project collision system for better change/tweak ability, after having to completely redo it. Overall project completion is about 8-12%.</p>
			</li>
			<li>6:00pm/31/1/2020:
				<p>Officially completed the Scratch Pad Strings project, no longer "brute forcing" the project complete.</p>
			</li>
			<li>12:00am/30/1/2020:
				<p>Added and modified web site pages to accommodate for the Scratch Pad Strings project, and couldn't access AWS and didn't add on VSC, so I installed it manually and got it "Completed".</p>
				<p>Something likely got messed up on install, but I found a bypass to make it work and tried to make that look similar to what was asked or what I thought was asked, hence "Completed".</p>
			</li>
			<li>8:30pm/29/1/2020:
				<p>Successful collision gotten in personal project (still needs work). Next up is replacing/remaking all the previous games in it.</p>

			<li>12:34pm/24/1/2020:
				<p>Major code streamlining/compacting (personal preference & milliseconds of loading time!... probably.).</p>

				<p>Added inner window resolution button to main page (debugging purposes).</p>
				<p>Main page's navigation bars now transparent, and new main background.</p>
