			<li>5:20pm/24/3/2020:

				<p>Uploaded project Underpants files, set up its button and added its Portfolio entry; moved the Change-Log button toward the top for better ease of adding buttons; backed up root index.</p>
			</li>
			<li>6:19pm/4/3/2020:
				<p>Officially finished Billypedia project unless a fix for its test's page becomes known, and patched styling for Billypedia spec page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>10:00pm/28/2/2020:
				<p>Basically finished Billypedia project, exept 3 of the tests say not done when they are, I will likely look into combining all tests to one page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>4:44pm/26/2/2020:
				<p>Uploaded the Billypedia project and updated root index to accommodate.</p>
			</li>
			<li>6:54pm/21/2/2020:
				<p>Finished Test and Function Guru, updated Portfolio page to include both new projects, and tweaked Change-Log page and did slight spellchecking.</p>
			</li>
			<li>2:40pm/19/2/2020:
				<p>Prep for upcoming projects: Test Guru and Function Guru.</p>
			</li>
			<li>11:00pm/8-14/2/2020:
				<p>Completed the Scratch Pad Conditionals project. Improved project Majg'e collisions, added coins that give points (not quite right yet), and streamlined/optimized code for better performance.</p>
			</li>
			<li>7:20pm/7/2/2020:
				<p>Uploaded all Scratch Pad projects, then updated root Index for the new projects, and moved movement system in Majg'e for modularity.</p>
			</li>
			<li>4:20pm/4/2/2020:
				<p>Updated save/backup files to the current index and previous portfolio. Revamped Portfolio page to include more detailed info of the site. Gave my personal JS project a new name: project Majg'e.</p>
			</li>
			<li>12:30am/1/2/2020:
				<p>Changed JS engine project collision system for better change/tweak ability, after having to completely redo it. Overall project completion is about 8-12%.</p>

				<p>Officially completed the Scratch Pad Strings project, no longer "brute forcing" the project complete.</p>
			</li>
			<li>12:00am/30/1/2020:
				<p>Added and modified web site pages to accommodate for the Scratch Pad Strings project, and couldn't access AWS and didn't add on VSC, so I installed it manually and got it "Completed".</p>
				<p>Something likely got messed up on install, but I found a bypass to make it work and tried to make that look similar to what was asked or what I thought was asked, hence "Completed".</p>
			</li>
			<li>8:30pm/29/1/2020:
				<p>Successful collision gotten in personal project (still needs work). Next up is replacing/remaking all the previous games in it.</p>

				<p>Major code streamlining/compacting (personal preference & milliseconds of loading time!... probably.).</p>
				<p>Bouncing-Box update/rescue (JavaScript code didn't even look like JavaScript code... thanks beginner me).</p>
				<p>Main page's script moved to last in body (fixed countless things).</p>
				<p>Added inner window resolution button to main page (debugging purposes).</p>
				<p>Main page's navigation bars now transparent, and new main background.</p>
			</li>
			<li>8:30pm/21/1/2020:
